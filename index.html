        <summary>Better Malware protection</summary>
        <p>
          While (almost?) no linux distro has an antivirus pre-installed, its
          fast and easy to install them.<br />and its true that they arent as
          good as windows antiviruses, its pretty unlikely for a malware dev to
          target linux, since its such a small chance that they will get anyone
          with their virus that uses linux

          Faster / less resource heavy (does NOT exclude very good PCs)
        </summary>
        <p>
          Linux virtually runs on everything, this includes a 2002 laptop,
          screens in your trains, small basic hardware, or supercomputers.
          <br />Apps run almost always faster on linux than on windows (except
          they use heavy windows libraries that only have bad ports for linux)

          If you never used linux, and decided to start using it, thinking it
          will be hard, and you actually do things flawlessly is a great
          feeling.<br />its better than simply pressing two buttons on windows
          and suddenly you have some random chinese browser that uses your GPU a
          little more than it should use

          "Wow, you use linux? you must be good with computers"<br />"Wow, you
          use linux? what a fucking nerd"<br />You can annoy you friends flex on
          those who dont know PC's, and do random useless shit while others
          think your doing something of meaning

        <summary>Customizability</summary>
        Go ahead, come back to me after you changed the windows logo on your
        task bar, im waiting. bitch<br />While windows "customization" is
        switching to dark mode, downloading wallpaper engine, and changing your
        refresh rate,<br />linux lets you choose if you even want a wallpaper,
        it lets you choose how your app icons look like, it lets you choose how
        your time is displayed, it lets you choose if you want a task bar

            >Linux being unstable was years ago, and even then it wasnt bad.
            these days its more stable than windows, or mac (depending what
            distro you use. dont be a dumbass)</be

          "mimi windows lets me do clicky clicky and now im playing games, linux
          makes me type 50 lines of code to install a browser mimi"<br />again,
          that were the old days, firefox is preinstalled on almost all distros,
          and some have steam pre-installed too
